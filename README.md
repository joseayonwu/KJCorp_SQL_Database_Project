## Project Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of a professional MySQL database for **KJ CORP**, a Peruvian retail and distribution company specializing in solar energy systems, electronic locks, and hardware products.  

The goal was to migrate from manual spreadsheets to a centralized, normalized SQL schema that ensures data integrity, enables analytical reporting, and supports decision-making across supplier management, inventory, sales, and payments.  

The entire system was developed as part of the **Master of Data Analytics program at the University of Niagara Falls Canada (2025)**.

## Schema Overview
The database contains ten normalized tables supporting key retail operations:

| Core Tables | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| Company | Company information and legal details |
| Suppliers | Vendor master data |
| Categories | Product grouping and classification |
| Products | Product-level details (brand, model, price) |
| Inventory | Stock tracking per product |
| Customers | End-customer registry |
| Sales | Main transaction records |
| Sales_Details | Line-item transaction details |
| Payments | Sales and supplier payments |
| Employees | Staff and internal roles |

## How to Run
To create and populate the database locally, open MySQL Workbench and execute:

```sql
SOURCE ./sql/kjcorp_schema_and_queries.sql;
```
This single script:

- Creates the database `KJCorpDB`
- Defines all normalized tables and relationships
- Inserts anonymized sample data
- Runs analytical queries for reporting and insights

After execution, refresh the schema list in MySQL Workbench — you should see all tables with data loaded.

## Analytical Queries (Samples)
Example queries included in the project:

```sql
-- Top-selling products
SELECT p.name, SUM(sd.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM Sales_Details sd
JOIN Products p ON sd.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC;

-- Total revenue by customer
SELECT c.name AS customer, SUM(s.total_amount) AS revenue
FROM Sales s
JOIN Customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name;
```
These queries support future integration with Power BI or Tableau dashboards for advanced analytics.
